GeoShield ,"GeoShield is an ambitious and innovative project set to revolutionize the Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) landscape. This project aims to develop a unique geolocation browser extension exclusively for organizations, providing an automated solution for tracing the geographical origins of images and videos.   Our focus extends from terrestrial landscapes to celestial bodies, offering a comprehensive geolocation experience. By leveraging advanced technologies like JavaScript, Python, and Machine Learning, GeoShield will deliver accurate, swift, and efficient geolocation services.   Key Features:  1. Image and Video Geolocation: GeoShield automatically analyzes images and videos, extracting key features to estimate their geographical origins. It doesn't matter whether the subject of the image is land or stars; GeoShield is equipped to handle both.  2. Sustainability: The project is committed to promoting sustainability by optimizing resource usage, reducing the carbon footprint typically associated with high computing tasks.  3. Versatility: Whether it's front-end design, back-end logic, image processing, or ML model training, GeoShield is crafted with diverse skill sets and inputs.  We're currently in the process of assembling a dedicated team of enthusiasts and developers with a passion for OSINT, keen on making a lasting impact in the community. This is an opportunity to collaborate on a project that combines cutting-edge technology with real-world applications. Interested individuals are encouraged to connect for more detailed information.  With GeoShield, let's elevate the future of geolocation technology and make a positive, sustainable difference.   — From Project Leader: this is meant to be a Entertaining and productive project.  — Because of sensitivity: Close project, not for everyone.

Jarvis - July 23,"https://github.com/Feynman10/JV-GPT  Our human-made GitHub voice assistant is a cutting-edge project developed by a dedicated team.  Voice Assistant Project This project aims to develop a voice assistant using speech recognition, natural language processing, and text-to-speech conversion technologies. The voice assistant is designed to provide an interactive and hands-free interface for users to interact with the system using voice commands.  Features Speech Recognition: The assistant utilizes the speech_recognition library to capture audio input from the microphone and convert it into text for further processing.  Natural Language Processing: OpenAI's GPT-4 model is employed to generate responses based on user queries. The assistant utilizes the openai library to interact with OpenAI's API for language processing.  Text-to-Speech Conversion: The assistant uses the gtts library to convert generated responses into spoken words. The text-to-speech functionality enables the assistant to communicate with users audibly.",,Jun 2023,Jun 2023
