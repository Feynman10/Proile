Addressing the Emergence of Unwitting Agents through Brain-Computer Interfaces in Counterintelligence and National Security,"Apr 3, 2023","In this era of technological advancements, counterintelligence efforts must address the emerging threat posed by the use of unwitting agents, created through brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), to infiltrate and subvert governments. BCIs have the potential to produce individuals with exceptional capabilities in various sectors, such as sports, entertainment, and beyond, which could have significant implications for national security. This paper discusses the ethical, social, and technical challenges posed by BCIs in the context of counterintelligence and national security, focusing on the potential emergence of unwitting agents. Drawing from recent research and developments in the field, we propose strategies to address these challenges and mitigate potential risks.
